      <description>I&amp;#8217;m a big fan of Microsoft&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Natural Ergonomic Keyboard 4000&amp;#8221;. I&amp;#8217;m just not a fan of it&amp;#8217;s name, it&amp;#8217;s a mouthful! (How about for future reference we just call it the Ergo?)
&amp;nbsp;
The Ergo&amp;#8217;s great for typing on and also has a selection of feature keys that you can key-map to. Depending on your distro/desktop environment, you can map keys for all sorts of reasons: to replace caps lock with ctrl, control your music player, to run scripts, etc.</description>

      <description>I keep a lot of notes&amp;#8230;
Writing notes Any time I&amp;#8217;m researching anything computing related, whether it&amp;#8217;s for work or in my spare time, I keep a log of my &amp;#8220;stream of conciousness&amp;#8221;. This includes thoughts like &amp;#8220;I think this is because&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;I wonder if this is related to&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;, &amp;#8220;What the fuck is&amp;#8230;?&amp;#8221;.
This is great when I&amp;#8217;ve spent a lot of time learning something new and I can look back over them once a week to reinforce the stuff I&amp;#8217;ve covered.</description>

      <title>Docker Security Risks: GUIs &#43; Xorg</title>
      <link>http://blog.nicro.land/p496/</link>

      <description>Recently I wrote a post where I was running a GUI application in a docker container. I did so because I couldn&amp;#8217;t be confident of the software&amp;#8217;s origins and thought it&amp;#8217;d be best not to take any chances. What other potential exploits does this leave one vulnerable to and how can one best protect themselves?
But isn&amp;#8217;t everything running in Docker secure? First things first, let&amp;#8217;s talk about what kind of security assurances docker tries to provide and under what circumstances those assurances would be considered null and void.</description>

      <title>Nested decorator functions in Python</title>
      <link>http://blog.nicro.land/p555/</link>

      <description>When I was at PyConIE last October I was talking with an old friend about Python&amp;#8217;s decorator functions.
He lamented how you need to google around for tutorials any time you wanted to write a parametrised decorator because it can be so confusing. I told him that there was a way to do it by nesting decorator functions which is much simpler than implementing them using classes (which seems to be the widely known about way).</description>

      <title>Running QtCreator in Docker</title>

      <description>Update: I wrote a follow up post detailing potential security risks of running GUIs in containers, check it out here.
The first thing I ever tried installing from source was Qt. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, Qt is a cross platform framework for writing GUI applications.
That was then&amp;#8230; I was in college, I had a macbook at the time and I was toying around with writing GUIs with Python/Tkinter.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series that I&amp;#8217;ll (hopefully) send out every week. It&amp;#8217;ll cover the problems I have during the week as well as how I overcome those issues.
Hopefully this will be of some use to people out there, leave me a comment if you find any of this useful!
Docker machine + docker compose

So I&amp;#8217;ve been playing around with docker-machine while working on a pet project of mine: daftpunk.</description>
