      <description>I know that it&amp;#8217;s been a while since I wrote a post! I haven&amp;#8217;t been keeping up with my own goal to write something new at least every week.
At first this was because I was on holidays and internet access was spotty at best. More recently I&amp;#8217;ve been very busy at work and not had as much time for reflection. I wanted to call this out here to keep myself honest and to make a fresh commitment!</description>
