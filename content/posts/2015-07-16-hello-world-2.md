## Why I started this blog

I'm not very good at writing about my experiences, I prefer to just talk. In fact I could ramble on about my own thing all night, constantly meandering and exploring tangents as I go.

I've decided that I should put more of an effort into collecting my thoughts in blog form so that I can focus them. At the very least I hope this will make me a better developer but maybe I'll help others who run into the same stumbling blocks on their own journey.

## What I intend to write about

To start off I'm hoping to write a weekly summary of interesting things I learned; whether it's something from my professional work or a pet project.

In the future, I may post updates about some of my pet projects or events I attend but no promises just yet.
