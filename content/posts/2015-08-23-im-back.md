I know that it's been a while since I wrote a post! I haven't been keeping up with my own goal to write something new at least every week.

At first this was because I was on holidays and internet access was spotty at best. More recently I've been very busy at work and not had as much time for reflection. I wanted to call this out here to keep myself honest and to make a fresh commitment!

Taking the time to write this blog is in my own interest because it pushes me to develop certain aspects of myself (writing skills, communication, confidence). I love that it gives me an excuse to explore technical subjects in greater depth and to showcase what I find out. Lastly (and I know I've said this before) I hope that it serves as a record and guide for others who are starting out in the software space.

I would urge anyone with an interest in tech to start a blog of their own. It's a great way to become a more rounded person and, with enough time and effort, will have a massive effect on your career! Reach out to me [on twitter][1] if you need some advice about this.

I'll be back with some more weekly updates soon!
