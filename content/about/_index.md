I&#8217;m many things; software developer, board game geek, sugar junkie. At the end of the day I&#8217;m just someone who loves to learn and discover new things. Whether it&#8217;s finding out how certain software works or exploring a new language, I&#8217;m driven to illuminate the unknown, find new perspectives and, whenever possible, share that journey with others.

This blog is intended to be as much about documenting the things I learn as it is about reaching out to like minded people who can&#8217;t/won&#8217;t stop till their curiosity is satisfied!
