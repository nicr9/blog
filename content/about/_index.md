I've filled a few different roles in my career; Software Developer, DevOps Consultant, Site Reliability Engineer. I have a tendancy to move around looking for new challenges because I love to learn and discover new things. I'm a generalist at heart.

Whether it's finding out how certain software works or exploring a new language, I'm driven to illuminate the unknown, find new perspectives and, whenever possible, share that journey with others.

This blog is intended to be as much about documenting the things I learn as it is about reaching out to like minded people who can't/won't stop till their curiosity is satisfied!

From time to time I may blog about one of my many hobbies too; here's the ones that I can represent with emoji:
