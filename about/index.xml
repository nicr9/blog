      <description>I&amp;#8217;m many things; software developer, board game geek, sugar junkie. At the end of the day I&amp;#8217;m just someone who loves to learn and discover new things. Whether it&amp;#8217;s finding out how certain software works or exploring a new language, I&amp;#8217;m driven to illuminate the unknown, find new perspectives and, whenever possible, share that journey with others.
This blog is intended to be as much about documenting the things I learn as it is about reaching out to like minded people who can&amp;#8217;t/won&amp;#8217;t stop till their curiosity is satisfied!</description>
