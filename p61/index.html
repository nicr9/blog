<p>I&#8217;ve been spending time lately learning Go and I thought I&#8217;d throw some of my thoughts down here. As the title implies my experience is mostly in Python so expect lots of apples to oranges comparisons!</p>

<p><a href="https://blog.golang.org/5years/gophers5th.jpg" target="_blank"><img class="alignnone" src="https://blog.golang.org/5years/gophers5th.jpg" alt="￼Taken from the golang blog" width="1262" height="733" /></a></p>

<h2 id="tooling">Tooling</h2>

<p>I guess the first thing that jumps out is the quality of the tooling, I&#8217;ve only had a chance to play around with a few of the CLI&#8217;s features but already I&#8217;m impressed with how simple it makes some day to day things.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re looking at new code for the first time the first thing on your mind is usually vendoring dependencies (I didn&#8217;t realise &#8216;vendor&#8217; is a verb, ya learn something new every day). &#8220;<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Download_and_install_packages_and_dependencies" target="_blank">go get</a> &#8230;&#8221; will download and install individual dependencies but it can also recursively scan through a project to save you the effort:</p>

<p>[code]</p>

<p>go get -d ./&#8230;</p>

<p>[/code]</p>

<p>This can pull in code automagically from git repositories (mercurial, bazaar and subversion too) which is nice and it doesn&#8217;t involve installing an extra package like pip/setuptools.</p>

<p>When you&#8217;re adding changes to code don&#8217;t forget about <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/gofmt/" target="_blank">gofmt</a>. It takes advantage of the relative ease of parsing Go&#8217;s syntax to automate/enforce certain elements of coding style like use of whitespace. It&#8217;s also really easy to include in your workflow; I use <a href="https://github.com/fatih/vim-go" target="_blank">fatih/vim-go</a>, a vim plugin that (among other cool things) runs gofmt every time you save changes. If vim&#8217;s not your style (pun not intended) then it&#8217;s easy to find <a href="https://golang.org/misc/git/pre-commit" target="_blank">docs for setting up a git hook</a> that runs gofmt before you commit.</p>

<p>There are some other tools that use Go&#8217;s simplicity to automate away the boring stuff. These are tools I haven&#8217;t had a lot of time to try out but for the adventurous: <a href="http://godoc.org/golang.org/x/tools/cmd/godoc" target="_blank">godoc</a> &#8220;extracts and generates documentation for Go programs&#8221; and <a href="http://golang.org/cmd/fix/" target="_blank">gofix</a> which &#8220;finds Go programs that use old APIs and rewrites them to use newer ones.&#8221; The later one sounds particularly ambitious! Reminds me of <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/2to3.html" target="_blank">2to3</a>, which never offered any guarantees other than a helping hand; you were still expected to go most of the porting work yourself.</p>

<p>Next step is usually building/installing code; the &#8220;<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_packages_and_dependencies" target="_blank">go build</a>&#8221; and &#8220;<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Compile_and_install_packages_and_dependencies" target="_blank">go install</a>&#8221; commands serve all your needs here. No need to choose between packaging libs like setuptools and distribute! The problem here is that what these packaging libs provide for is a standard way of declaring package metadata so that they can be found on an index like <a href="http://pypi.python.org" target="_blank">PYPI</a>, which leads me to&#8230;</p>

<h2 id="argh-packaging">Argh! Packaging!</h2>

<p>So far this is the first big thing missing for Go and I&#8217;m not entirely sure how I feel about it!</p>

<p>On the one hand there is no need to set up and actively maintain your project listings on a centralised site; all you need to do is to choose (and choice is important to developers) which site you host your code on.</p>

<p>On the other hand PYPI can really leverage that metadata and offer a powerful way to search for the package you need. If you haven&#8217;t tried browsing by package category before, <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi?%3Aaction=browse" target="_blank">give it a quick try</a> so you can see what I mean. I can wait&#8230;</p>

<p>I tried looking into a similar resource for golang and most of the internet pointed me to godashboard.appspot.com/project, which seems to be down at the time of writing. After a little bit of research it seems that the listings it hosted were moved around some wikis till they found their new home at <a href="https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Projects" target="_blank">https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Projects</a>. Having this page in the language&#8217;s git wiki seems to makes sense in terms of go&#8217;s philosophy but it just leaves me wanting something better.</p>

<h2 id="but-i-digress-8230-lets-talk-about-testing">But I Digress&#8230; Lets Talk About Testing</h2>

<p>So the compiler hasn&#8217;t found any problems in the code; it all builds without issue. Hurray!</p>

<p>The next thing to check is tests and the command for running them is (big surprise here, drum-roll please) &#8220;<a href="https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Test_packages" target="_blank">go test</a>&#8220;. This quite frankly makes &#8220;python -m unittest discover&#8221; look like an afterthought.</p>

<p>Here&#8217;s something that shocked me when I was writing tests: there&#8217;s no assertions in Go! <a href="https://golang.org/doc/faq#assertions" target="_blank">The aim here</a> was to remove a crutch that developers too often use to avoid thinking about proper error handling. That should be a top consideration when you&#8217;re writing server-side code; if you&#8217;re not careful with errors requests will die and cause lots of trouble for the client.</p>

<p>So what do tests look like in a world without assertions? Not that different really, assertions are just if statements with some syntactic sugar to make things look a bit more formal. All you need is to write your own if statements and make calls to &#8220;t.Fatal(&#8230;)&#8221; if things look broken.</p>

<p>I did some soul searching regarding this; is there anything that we really lose from leaving assertions out of the language? At first I was a bit miffed because I&#8217;m used to the array of assertions available as member functions of unittest.TestCase in Python but I got over it quickly! Keystrokes saved while writing tests aren&#8217;t worth it if it means people get lazy with error handling.</p>

<h2 id="convention-over-configuration">Convention Over Configuration</h2>

<p>The common theme that I keep coming back to in my head here is &#8220;what can we automate by relying on a convention and what should we let developers control by way of configuration?&#8221;.</p>

<p>Go&#8217;s tooling stuff all depends on a strict directory structure and syntax (which probably required a lot of thinking on Google&#8217;s part). Python&#8217;s package distribution relies on the maintainer filling out setup.py. Both languages also have conventions regarding writing test cases to facilitate test discovery.</p>

<p>It makes me think a lot about the upfront investment in terms of reading docs. When you&#8217;re starting out learning programming, documentation can be daunting; there&#8217;s a hell of a lot of it! I&#8217;m not ready to say which language has the greater learning curve for developers starting out but it&#8217;s a very important consideration</p>

<h2 id="more-rambling">More Rambling?</h2>

<p>I realise that this post has been far from a comprehensive comparison and that there are many important things I left out, e.g., goroutines vs asyncio, support for paradigms like OO and functional programming, third party libraries, etc.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s way too much to cover in a single blog post. I hope to write more as I get familiar with the language and maybe I&#8217;ll ramble about other technologies too!</p>

<p>If you have any comments, suggestions, or questions feel free to get in contact with me! I&#8217;d love to hear from you.</p>
