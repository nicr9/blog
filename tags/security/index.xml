      <description>Recently I wrote a post where I was running a GUI application in a docker container. I did so because I couldn&amp;#8217;t be confident of the software&amp;#8217;s origins and thought it&amp;#8217;d be best not to take any chances. What other potential exploits does this leave one vulnerable to and how can one best protect themselves?
But isn&amp;#8217;t everything running in Docker secure? First things first, let&amp;#8217;s talk about what kind of security assurances docker tries to provide and under what circumstances those assurances would be considered null and void.</description>
