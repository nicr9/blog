      <description>Update:Â I wrote a follow up post detailing potential security risks of running GUIs in containers, check it out here.
The first thing I ever tried installing from source was Qt. For those who don&amp;#8217;t know, Qt is a cross platform framework for writing GUI applications.
That was then&amp;#8230; I was in college, I had a macbook at the time and I was toying around with writing GUIs with Python/Tkinter.</description>
