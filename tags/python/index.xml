      <description>When I was at PyConIE last October I was talking with an old friend about Python&amp;rsquo;s decorator functions.
He lamented how you need to google around for tutorials any time you wanted to write a parametrised decorator because it can be so confusing. I told him that there was a way to do it by nesting decorator functions which is much simpler than implementing them using classes (which seems to be the widely known about way).</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been spending time lately learning Go and I thought I&amp;rsquo;d throw some of my thoughts down here. As the title implies my experience is mostly in Python so expect lots of apples to oranges comparisons!

Tooling I guess the first thing that jumps out is the quality of the tooling, I&amp;rsquo;ve only had a chance to play around with a few of the CLI&amp;rsquo;s features but already I&amp;rsquo;m impressed with how simple it makes some day to day things.</description>

      <description>setup.py and rpm.spec So recently at work I needed to package a tool we wrote at work. The tool was written in Python (big surprise) and it was designed to be run as a daemon so it had an init-script.
Python tools are generally packaged by writing a setup.py script. There are actually a number of tools you can use (I&amp;rsquo;ve used distutils and setuptools in the past) and there&amp;rsquo;s a bit of a confusing history regarding which tool is recommended.</description>
