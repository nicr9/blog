      <description>I keep a lot of notes&amp;hellip;
Writing notes Any time I&amp;rsquo;m researching anything computing related, whether it&amp;rsquo;s for work or in my spare time, I keep a log of my &amp;ldquo;stream of conciousness&amp;rdquo;. This includes thoughts like &amp;ldquo;I think this is because&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;I wonder if this is related to&amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;What the fuck is&amp;hellip;?&amp;rdquo;.
This is great when I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a lot of time learning something new and I can look back over them once a week to reinforce the stuff I&amp;rsquo;ve covered.</description>

      <description>Recently I wrote a post where I was running a GUI application in a docker container. I did so because I couldn&amp;rsquo;t be confident of the software&amp;rsquo;s origins and thought it&amp;rsquo;d be best not to take any chances. What other potential exploits does this leave one vulnerable to and how can one best protect themselves?
But isn&amp;rsquo;t everything running in Docker secure? First things first, let&amp;rsquo;s talk about what kind of security assurances docker tries to provide and under what circumstances those assurances would be considered null and void.</description>

      <title>Running QtCreator in Docker</title>

      <description>Update: I wrote a follow up post detailing potential security risks of running GUIs in containers, check it out here.
The first thing I ever tried installing from source was Qt. For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Qt is a cross platform framework for writing GUI applications.
That was then&amp;hellip; I was in college, I had a macbook at the time and I was toying around with writing GUIs with Python/Tkinter. I kept fighting against Tkinter&amp;rsquo;s limitations and I finally decided it was time to find something with more power.</description>

      <description>This is the first post in a series that I&amp;rsquo;ll (hopefully) send out every week. It&amp;rsquo;ll cover the problems I have during the week as well as how I overcome those issues.
Hopefully this will be of some use to people out there, leave me a comment if you find any of this useful!
Docker machine + docker compose So I&amp;rsquo;ve been playing around with docker-machine while working on a pet project of mine: daftpunk.</description>
